        "\n",
        "2. **Performance**:\n",
        "   - **Mutable Objects**: Generally faster for operations that involve modifications, as no new object needs to be created.\n",
        "   - **Immutable Objects**: Can be less efficient for operations involving frequent changes, as new objects are created for every modification.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Usage**:\n",
        "   - **Mutable Objects**: Used when you need to modify the data in place, such as in algorithms that need to update data structures dynamically.\n",
        "   - **Immutable Objects**: Used for data that should not change, providing safety from unintended modifications and often used as keys in dictionaries due to their hashability.\n",

        "Loops in Python allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly based on certain conditions. Python provides two main types of loops: `for` and `while`. Here’s a description of each type along with their use cases and examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **`for` Loop**\n",
        "\n",
        "The `for` loop is used for iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string) or other iterable objects. It is generally used when you know the number of iterations in advance.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Syntax\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "for variable in sequence:\n",
        "    # code to execute for each item in sequence\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Use Cases\n",
        "\n",
        "- Iterating over a list of items.\n",
        "- Executing code a fixed number of times.\n",
        "- Iterating over characters in a string.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Examples\n",
        "\n",
        "**Iterating Over a List**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
        "\n",
        "for fruit in fruits:\n",
        "    print(fruit)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Explanation**: This loop iterates over each item in the `fruits` list and prints it.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Using `range()`**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "for i in range(5):\n",
        "    print(i)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Explanation**: This loop iterates from 0 to 4 (5 is exclusive) and prints each number.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Iterating Over a Dictionary**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "student_scores = {\"Alice\": 85, \"Bob\": 90, \"Charlie\": 78}\n",
        "\n",
        "for student, score in student_scores.items():\n",
        "    print(f\"{student}: {score}\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Explanation**: This loop iterates over the key-value pairs in the `student_scores` dictionary and prints each student’s name along with their score.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **`while` Loop**\n",
        "\n",
        "The `while` loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as its condition remains true. It is used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand and depends on a condition being met.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Syntax\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "while condition:\n",
        "    # code to execute as long as condition is true\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Use Cases\n",
        "\n",
        "- Executing code until a certain condition changes.\n",
        "- Waiting for user input or external events.\n",
        "- Repeating actions until a desired state is achieved.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Examples\n",
        "\n",
        "**Basic `while` Loop**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "counter = 0\n",
        "\n",
        "while counter < 5:\n",
        "    print(counter)\n",
        "    counter += 1\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Explanation**: This loop prints numbers from 0 to 4. The `counter` variable is incremented by 1 on each iteration until it reaches 5, causing the loop to terminate.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Infinite Loop with Break**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "while True:\n",
        "    user_input = input(\"Enter 'exit' to quit: \")\n",
        "    if user_input == 'exit':\n",
        "        break\n",
        "    print(f\"You entered: {user_input}\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Explanation**: This loop continuously prompts the user for input and prints it. The loop runs indefinitely until the user types 'exit', at which point the `break` statement terminates the loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Using `while` with `else`**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "n = 0\n",
        "\n",
        "while n < 3:\n",
        "    print(n)\n",
        "    n += 1\n",
        "else:\n",
        "    print(\"Loop ended.\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Explanation**: This loop prints numbers from 0 to 2. The `else` block executes after the loop completes normally (i.e., when the condition becomes false).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`for` Loop**: Best for iterating over a fixed sequence or a range of values. It's ideal when you know the number of iterations or are iterating over a collection of items.\n",
        "- **`while` Loop**: Best for scenarios where the number of iterations is not known ahead of time and depends on a condition being met. Be cautious with infinite loops and ensure you have a way to exit.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both types of loops are essential tools for controlling the flow of your program and executing repetitive tasks efficiently."
