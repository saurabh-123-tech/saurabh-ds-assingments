# 1. Explain the key features of Python that make it a popular choice for programming.
## Readability:-
Python's syntax is designed to be clear and easy to understand, making it a great language for beginners and experienced programmers alike. 

## Simplicity:-
Python has a relatively small set of keywords and built-in functions, which makes it easy to learn and use.

## libraries:-
Python has a vast ecosystem of libraries that can be used for a variety of purposes, such as data science, data analysis, machine learning, and web development.


# 2. Describe the role of predefined keywords in Python and provide examples of how they are used in a program.
Predefined keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meaning and cannot be used as variable names. They are used to control the flow of a program, define data types, and perform other essential tasks. Here are some examples:

## if:-
Used to execute code conditionally.

## else:-
Used to execute code if the if condition is not met.

## for:-
Used to iterate over a sequence of items.

## while:-
Used to execute code repeatedly as long as a condition is true.

## def:-
Used to define a function.

## return:-
Used to return a value from a function.


# 3. Compare and contrast mutable and immutable objects in Python with examples.

## Mutable objects:-
Objects whose values can be changed after they are created. Examples include lists, dictionaries, and sets. 
## Immutable objects:-
Objects whose values cannot be changed after they are created. Examples include strings, numbers, and tuples.

Here's an example to illustrate the difference:-

# 4. Discuss the different types of operators in Python and provide examples of how they are used.
Python supports several types of operators, including:

## Arithmetic operators:
Used for performing mathematical operations, such as +, -, *, /, %, //, and **.

## Comparison operators:
Used for comparing values, such as ==, !=, >, <, >=, and <=.

## Logical operators:
Used for combining boolean expressions, such as and, or, and not.

## Assignment operators:
Used for assigning values to variables, such as =, +=, -=, *=, /=

# 5. Explain the concept of type casting in Python with examples.
Type casting is the process of converting one data type to another. Python supports several built-in functions for type casting, such as int(), float(), str(), and bool().

## 6. How do conditional statements work in Python? Illustrate with examples.
Conditional statements allow you to execute different code blocks based on whether a certain condition is true or false. Python supports the if, else, and elif (else if) statements.

# 7. Describe the different types of loops in Python and their use cases with examples.
Python supports two main types of loops: for loops and while loops.

## for loops:-
Used to iterate over a sequence of items, such as a list, tuple, or string.

## while loops:-
Used to execute code repeatedly as long as a condition is true.
