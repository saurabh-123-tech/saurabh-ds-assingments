        "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encapsulation**: This is the practice of keeping data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data bundled together within a class. Encapsulation hides the internal state of the object from the outside world and only exposes a controlled interface. This helps to protect the integrity of the data and provides a clear structure for how objects should be interacted with.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Abstraction**: Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the necessary features. In OOP, this means defining abstract classes and interfaces that specify what methods should be implemented without specifying how they should be implemented. This allows users to interact with objects at a higher level without needing to understand their inner workings.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Inheritance**: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows one class (the subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (the superclass or base class). This promotes code reuse and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes. Subclasses can extend or override the functionality of their parent classes, enabling polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. It enables a single interface to be used for different underlying data types. There are two main types of polymorphism: compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding). This helps in designing systems that are more flexible and easily extendable.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Classes and Objects**: Classes are blueprints or templates that define the structure and behavior (attributes and methods) of objects. Objects are instances of classes and represent specific occurrences of the class. Through classes and objects, OOP organizes and models real-world entities and their interactions in a programmatic way.\n",
        "\n",
        "These concepts work together to create a modular, reusable, and organized approach to software development."

        "Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm (also known as C3 superclass linearization) to compute the MRO.

        "The Diamond Problem is a common issue in object-oriented programming languages that support multiple inheritance. It arises when a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from a common base class. The problem occurs because the derived class may inherit properties and methods from the common base class through both paths, leading to ambiguity and confusion over which path to follow.\n",

        "### The Diamond Problem Explained\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider the following class hierarchy:\n",

        "If `D` calls a method or accesses an attribute that is defined in `A`, it might be unclear whether it should use the version from `B` or the one from `C`, or how to handle potential conflicts. This ambiguity can lead to unexpected behaviors.\n",
